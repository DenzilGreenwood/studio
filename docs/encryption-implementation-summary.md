# Encryption & Security Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive client-side encryption system with passphrase protection and recovery functionality for the CognitiveInsight app.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Authentication with Passphrase**
- **8-character minimum passphrase requirement** with strength validation
- Passphrase requirements:
  - At least 8 characters
  - Must contain uppercase letter
  - Must contain lowercase letter
  - Must contain number
  - Must contain special character

### 2. **Client-Side Encryption System**
- **Web Crypto API** based encryption using AES-GCM
- **PBKDF2** key derivation with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt and IV generation** for each encryption operation
- All user data can be encrypted before storage

### 3. **Recovery Key System**
- **64-character recovery key** generated during signup
- Recovery key encrypts the user's passphrase
- Users can recover their passphrase using the recovery key
- Recovery keys stored locally for backup access

### 4. **Secure Data Flow**
- Passphrase stored in sessionStorage during active session
- Encrypted passphrase stored in Firestore user profile
- Recovery metadata stored in localStorage for offline recovery
- Clear separation between authentication and encryption

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/src/lib/encryption.ts` - Core encryption utilities
- `/src/lib/encryption-context.tsx` - React context for encryption state

### Modified Files:
- `/src/components/auth/auth-form.tsx` - Enhanced with passphrase fields and recovery
- `/src/types/index.ts` - Added encryption fields to UserProfile
- `/src/lib/firestore-validators.ts` - Added validation for encryption fields
- `/src/app/layout.tsx` - Added EncryptionProvider
- `/src/context/auth-context.tsx` - Updated user creation to store encryption data

## Security Architecture

### Data Encryption Flow:
1. **Signup**: User creates passphrase → Recovery key generated → Passphrase encrypted with recovery key → Stored in Firestore
2. **Login**: User enters passphrase → Stored in session → Used for data encryption/decryption
3. **Recovery**: User enters recovery key → Retrieves encrypted passphrase → Decrypts and displays original passphrase

### Key Security Features:
- **No plain-text passphrases** stored anywhere
- **Client-side only encryption** - server never sees passphrases
- **Session-based passphrase storage** - cleared on logout
- **Recovery key backup** - allows passphrase recovery if forgotten
- **Strong cryptographic standards** - AES-GCM, PBKDF2, secure random generation

## User Experience

### Signup Process:
1. Enter email, password, and optional pseudonym
2. Create and confirm 8+ character passphrase
3. Consent to data use
4. System generates recovery key
5. User must save recovery key before proceeding

### Login Process:
1. Enter email and password (Firebase auth)
2. Enter security passphrase (for data decryption)
3. Alternative: Use "Forgot Passphrase" with recovery key
4. System retrieves and displays original passphrase if recovery successful

### Recovery Process:
1. Click "Forgot Passphrase? Use Recovery Key"
2. Enter email and recovery key
3. System decrypts and displays original passphrase
4. User can then log in normally with recovered passphrase

## Technical Implementation Details

### Encryption Utilities (`/src/lib/encryption.ts`):
- `generateRecoveryKey()` - Creates 64-char hex recovery key
- `encryptData()` / `decryptData()` - Core encryption functions
- `validatePassphrase()` - Strength validation
- `encryptPassphraseWithRecoveryKey()` - Recovery key encryption
- `storeEncryptionMetadata()` / `getEncryptionMetadata()` - Local storage helpers

### Database Schema Updates:
```typescript
UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  encryptedPassphrase?: string;    // Passphrase encrypted with recovery key
  passphraseSalt?: string;         // Salt for recovery key encryption
  passphraseIv?: string;          // IV for recovery key encryption
}
```

### Session Management:
- `sessionStorage.userPassphrase` - Current session passphrase
- `localStorage.encryption_metadata_{email}` - Recovery data backup

## Security Considerations

### Strengths:
✅ Client-side encryption ensures server never sees sensitive data  
✅ Strong cryptographic algorithms (AES-GCM, PBKDF2)  
✅ Recovery system prevents permanent data loss  
✅ Session-based storage with automatic cleanup  
✅ Comprehensive passphrase strength requirements  

### Important Notes:
⚠️ **Recovery key is critical** - without it, forgotten passphrases cannot be recovered  
⚠️ **Client-side only** - encryption/decryption happens in browser  
⚠️ **Session dependency** - passphrase must be re-entered each session  
⚠️ **Local storage backup** - recovery metadata stored locally for offline access  

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

To complete the encryption system, you would need to:

1. **Encrypt sensitive data** before storing in Firestore using the user's passphrase
2. **Decrypt data** when loading from Firestore using the session passphrase
3. **Add encryption helpers** for common data operations
4. **Implement data migration** for existing users
5. **Add encryption status indicators** in the UI
6. **Create encrypted backup/export** functionality

The foundation is now in place for a comprehensive client-side encryption system that gives users full control over their data security while maintaining usability through the recovery key system.
