# Journal Navigation Update Summary

## Problem
The "My Journal" dropdown option in the user header was causing errors and didn't properly connect users to the new enhanced journaling system with AI reflections and goal tracking.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated App Header Navigation (`src/components/layout/app-header.tsx`)
- ✅ **Changed dropdown text**: "My Journal" → "Session History" for clarity
- ✅ **Improved navigation**: Users now understand they're going to a session list rather than expecting a single journal page

### 2. Enhanced Sessions Page (`src/app/(app)/sessions/page.tsx`)
- ✅ **Updated page title**: "My Journal" → "Session History" 
- ✅ **Improved description**: Added mention of AI insights and goal tracking features
- ✅ **Added journal buttons**: Each completed session now has both "View Report" and "Open Journal" buttons
- ✅ **Enhanced UI**: Split buttons for better UX - users can choose between report or journal
- ✅ **Added info card**: New prominent card explaining the enhanced journaling features
- ✅ **Feature badges**: Visual indicators showing "AI Reflection", "Goal Tracking", "Progress Analytics", and "Personal Notes"

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **Clear navigation path**: Users can now easily access journals from session cards
- ✅ **Feature discovery**: Info card helps users understand new journaling capabilities
- ✅ **Visual hierarchy**: Better button layout makes journal access more prominent
- ✅ **Intuitive labeling**: "Session History" is clearer than "My Journal" for a list page

## New User Flow
1. **Header Dropdown** → "Session History" → Sessions list page
2. **Session Cards** → Choose "Open Journal" → Individual journal with AI insights
3. **Info Card** → Explains enhanced features before users explore
