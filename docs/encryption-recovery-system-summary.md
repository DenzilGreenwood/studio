# Encryption + Recovery Key System Implementation Summary

## 🔐 Complete Implementation

The encryption system has been successfully updated with the following new architecture:

### 1. **Core Encryption (cryptoUtils.ts)**
- ✅ **Client-side AES-GCM encryption** with streamlined format
- ✅ **PBKDF2 key derivation** (100,000 iterations, SHA-256)
- ✅ **64-character recovery key generation**
- ✅ **Passphrase backup encryption** using recovery key
- ✅ **Passphrase validation** with strength requirements
- ✅ **Base64 encoded output** (no separate salt/IV storage needed)

### 2. **Recovery Service (services/recoveryService.ts)**
- ✅ **Firestore integration** for recovery key storage
- ✅ **Encrypted passphrase storage** in `recovery` collection
- ✅ **Recovery passphrase function** for "Forgot Passphrase" flow
- ✅ **Error handling** for invalid recovery keys

### 3. **Data Encryption (data-encryption.ts)**
- ✅ **Updated to use new crypto system**
- ✅ **Streamlined encryption format** (single encrypted field per data item)
- ✅ **All existing functions maintained**:
  - `encryptUserProfile` / `decryptUserProfile`
  - `encryptSessionData` / `decryptSessionData`
  - `encryptChatMessage` / `decryptChatMessage`
  - `encryptJournalEntry` / `decryptJournalEntry`
  - `encryptFeedback` / `decryptFeedback`

### 4. **Authentication Integration (auth-form.tsx)**
- ✅ **Signup flow** updated to use new recovery system
- ✅ **Recovery flow** updated to use Firestore-based recovery
- ✅ **Passphrase validation** integrated
- ✅ **Recovery key display** for users to save securely

### 5. **Updated Import Paths**
- ✅ **sessions/page.tsx** updated to use new encryption
- ✅ **Clean import structure** with services directory

## 🔒 Security Features

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Client-side encryption** | ✅ AES-GCM with 256-bit keys |
| **Key derivation** | ✅ PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations |
| **Recovery key** | ✅ 64-character cryptographically secure |
| **Passphrase storage** | ✅ Session-only (never sent to server) |
| **Backup encryption** | ✅ Passphrase encrypted with recovery key |
| **Zero server access** | ✅ Server never sees plaintext data |

## 🚀 Usage Flow

### During Signup:
1. User creates account with passphrase
2. System generates 64-character recovery key
3. Passphrase is encrypted with recovery key
4. Encrypted passphrase stored in Firestore
5. Recovery key shown to user (must save securely)

### During Login:
1. User enters passphrase
2. Passphrase stored in session for encryption/decryption
3. All data encrypted/decrypted client-side

### During Recovery:
1. User enters recovery key
2. System retrieves encrypted passphrase from Firestore
3. Recovery key decrypts the passphrase
4. Recovered passphrase stored in session

## 🔧 Migration Notes

The system maintains backward compatibility while introducing the new streamlined format:
- Old encrypted data will still decrypt (if using old format)
- New data uses the streamlined base64 format
- All existing encryption functions preserved
- Session storage still used for passphrase management

## 🎯 Next Steps

The encryption system is now fully implemented and ready for use. Users can:
1. **Sign up** with automatic recovery key generation
2. **Back up their passphrase** using the recovery key
3. **Recover access** if they forget their passphrase
4. **Maintain complete privacy** with zero server-side data access

All journal entries, chat messages, session data, and user profiles remain encrypted with the user's passphrase, while the recovery system provides a secure backup mechanism.
