5. **User Responsibility**: "Please reflect critically and use your own judgment"

## Files Verified Clean

✅ **No therapy references found in:**

- App header and navigation
- Main layout and metadata

## Benefits of Changes

### 1. **Legal Protection**
- Clear positioning as consulting, not therapy
- Appropriate disclaimers and professional referrals
- Reduced liability exposure

### 2. **Professional Clarity**
- Consistent messaging across all touchpoints
- Proper expectations for users

## Validation

All changes have been systematically applied across:

- ✅ API route handlers

The platform now consistently presents itself as a **cognitive consulting and personal development tool** rather than a therapeutic service, with appropriate disclaimers and professional boundaries clearly established.

## Next Steps

1. **Review by Legal/Compliance**: Have updated language reviewed by legal team
2. **User Communication**: Inform existing users of positioning clarification
3. **Marketing Materials**: Update any external materials to reflect consulting positioning
4. **Training Data**: Ensure AI responses continue to maintain appropriate boundaries
