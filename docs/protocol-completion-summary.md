## Data Flow & Architecture

### Session Lifecycle:
1. **Initialization**: Check for active sessions → Create new or resume existing
2. **Protocol Execution**: 6-phase conversation with AI guidance
3. **Data Capture**: Key interactions stored for reframed beliefs and legacy statements
4. **Completion**: Sentiment analysis, summary generation, and session finalization
5. **Post-Session**: Feedback collection and report generation
6. **Journal Access**: AI reflection generation and goal setting

### Database Structure:
```
users/{userId}/sessions/{sessionId}/
├── session document (ProtocolSession)
├── messages/ (collection)
│   └── {messageId} (ChatMessage documents)
└── goals (embedded in session document)
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Start Protocol** → Resume existing or create new session
2. **6-Phase Conversation** → Guided by AI through cognitive consulting phases
3. **Session Completion** → Automatic summary and sentiment analysis
4. **Feedback Collection** → Post-session evaluation
5. **Session Report** → Complete summary and insights
6. **Journal Access** → AI reflection and goal management

## Technical Features

### Error Handling:
- ✅ Graceful AI failures with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Network error recovery
- ✅ Data validation and sanitization
- ✅ Session state consistency

### Performance:
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates for better responsiveness
- ✅ Efficient database queries
- ✅ Proper loading states
- ✅ Background processing for AI operations

### Security:
- ✅ User authentication required
- ✅ Data isolation per user
- ✅ Admin access controls
- ✅ Secure AI API calls

## Testing Recommendations

To test the completed protocol section:

1. **Create a test user account** with complete profile information
2. **Start a protocol session** and verify session resumption works
3. **Complete all 6 phases** to test the full flow
4. **Check session report** for proper data capture
5. **Use journal features** for AI reflection and goal setting
6. **Test error scenarios** like network failures
7. **Verify admin functionality** if applicable
