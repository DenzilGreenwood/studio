ðŸš€ Migration Script Instructions
================================

To run the migration for the test user, you have a few options:

Option 1: Browser Console (Recommended)
1. Open your app in the browser: http://localhost:3000
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the Console tab
4. Copy and paste this code:

import { runTestMigration } from './src/scripts/migrate-test-user.ts';
runTestMigration("Test@CognitiveInsight.ai").then(result => {
  console.log("Migration completed:", result);
}).catch(error => {
  console.error("Migration failed:", error);
});

Option 2: Create a temporary page
1. Create a temporary page in your app that calls the migration function
2. Navigate to that page to trigger the migration

Option 3: Add to existing admin page
1. Add a migration button to your admin page
2. Call the runTestMigration function when clicked

The migration script will:
- Look up the user by email (Test@CognitiveInsight.ai)
- Check their current sessions
- Migrate completed sessions to the new architecture
- Create reports and journals collections
- Show detailed progress and results
`);
